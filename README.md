# PDF to Excel Converter

A cross-platform desktop app built with Tauri, Vite, and FastAPI that extracts tables from selected pages of a PDF and outputs them in Excel format.

## Features

- Upload a PDF and select the pages containing tables.
- Extracts tables from specified pages and saves them as an Excel file.
- Built using a web stack (Vite for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend) and Tauri for desktop capabilities.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Required for Tauri to build the desktop app.
- **pnpm**: Used for package management in the Vite frontend. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- **Poetry**: Manages dependencies for the FastAPI backend. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
- **Ghostscript**: Required as it is used by camelot-py for extraction. Install [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/).
